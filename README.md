## Project requirements

Create a simple e-commerce website using React v16 above and Redux. For UI design
reference please check the images below. The website should be responsive and should
work in all device resolutions, though you can use your own creativity for the responsive UI
design. Follow all best practices and standards.

Points to consider:
• The Home screen should have minimum 20 books.
• Each book will have its Detail page and a Buy Now or Add to Cart Button.
• The Detail page of the item will have its picture, price, and features.
• Buy Now will quickly take the user to the Checkout screen while the Add to Cart
Button will store the Book in the Shopping Cart.
• At the Checkout screen, the user can review the billing information and the list of
items in the cart.
• A My Orders screen which will list all the books the user has bought till date.
